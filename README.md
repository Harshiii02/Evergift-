# 🎁 EverGift

EverGift is a beautifully crafted, animated web experience designed to bring a touch of elegance to gift-giving. From a dynamic login animation that folds a square into a virtual envelope, to smooth arc transitions between sections, EverGift is as much a visual delight as it is a functional platform.

## ✨ Features

- 📨 **Envelope-Style Login Animation**  
  A unique sign-in experience where the login form folds into a stylized envelope upon success.

- 🌄 **Hero Section with Animated Transition**  
  Clicking "Explore" zooms the background into a circle, transitioning into the main layout.

- 🌀 **Arc-Based Section Navigation**  
  Sections such as *About Us* and *Shop* animate into view using curved transitions for a modern aesthetic.

- 🎨 **Responsive Theme Switching**  
  The "About Us" section changes to a dark brown theme with cream text when 50% scrolled for better readability.

- 👤 **Meet the Creators**  
  Learn more about the creators, Harshita and Anivesh, through bios and images.
